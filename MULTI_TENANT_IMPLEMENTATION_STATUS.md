- ‚è≥ Update file deletion to respect package ID boundaries
- ‚è≥ Update file listing to filter by package ID

### 4. Admin Panel Multi-Tenant Support
**Priority: HIGH**
- ‚è≥ Add package ID selection/filtering in admin operations
- ‚è≥ Update admin dashboard to show package-specific statistics
- ‚è≥ Ensure admin users can manage content for both apps
- ‚è≥ Add package ID validation in admin content creation

### 5. API Documentation Updates
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- ‚è≥ Update Swagger documentation to include X-Package-ID header requirement
- ‚è≥ Update Postman collections with package ID examples
- ‚è≥ Document multi-tenant API usage patterns

### 6. Testing and Validation
**Priority: HIGH**
- ‚è≥ Create comprehensive test cases for data isolation
- ‚è≥ Test cross-tenant data leakage prevention
- ‚è≥ Validate package ID validation in all endpoints
- ‚è≥ Test backward compatibility with existing Seekho app

### 7. Security and Audit
**Priority: HIGH**
- ‚è≥ Implement audit logging for tenant-specific operations
- ‚è≥ Add comprehensive validation to prevent cross-tenant access
- ‚è≥ Review all database queries for package ID inclusion
- ‚è≥ Test edge cases and error scenarios

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run migration script on staging environment
- [ ] Verify all existing Seekho data has packageId set
- [ ] Test both apps independently
- [ ] Validate shared payment functionality
- [ ] Check file upload segregation

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for any cross-tenant data access
- [ ] Verify package ID validation is working
- [ ] Test new Bolo app registration and functionality
- [ ] Monitor performance impact of additional indexes

## üìã CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

### Environment Variables to Add
```env
# Multi-Tenant Configuration
SUPPORTED_PACKAGES=com.gumbo.learning,com.gumbo.english
DEFAULT_PACKAGE_ID=com.gumbo.learning

# Bolo App Configuration
BOLO_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your-bolo-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
BOLO_PACKAGE_NAME=com.gumbo.english
```

### Database Indexes
All models now have compound indexes with packageId as the first field for optimal query performance.

## üîß USAGE EXAMPLES

### API Requests
```http
# Seekho App Request
GET /api/categories
X-Package-ID: com.gumbo.learning

# Bolo App Request  
GET /api/categories
X-Package-ID: com.gumbo.english
```

### Backward Compatibility
Requests without X-Package-ID header default to `com.gumbo.learning` for backward compatibility.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Data Migration**: Must be run before deploying to production
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Seekho app will continue working without changes
3. **Shared Payments**: Payment system remains shared between both apps
4. **File Segregation**: Files are now organized by package ID in S3
5. **Database Performance**: New compound indexes optimize multi-tenant queries

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. Complete remaining controller updates (subscription, admin, auth)
2. Update all model static methods to include package ID
3. Run comprehensive testing on staging environment
4. Update API documentation
5. Deploy migration script and new code to production
