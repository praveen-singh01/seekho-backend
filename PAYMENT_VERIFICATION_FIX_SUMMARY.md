# Payment Verification Fix Summary

## Problem
The payment verification system was rejecting single-time payments with the error:
```
"Payment verification failed: Exception: Only subscription payments are supported. Please use monthly or yearly subscription."
```

This occurred because the `verifyPayment` function in `subscriptionController.js` was only handling recurring subscription payments and explicitly rejecting any payment without a `razorpay_subscription_id`.

## Solution
Modified the payment verification logic to support both **single-time payments** and **recurring subscription payments**.

## Files Modified

### 1. `controllers/subscriptionController.js`
### 2. `payments-service/controllers/subscriptionController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated the `verifyPayment` function to handle both payment types
- Added logic to verify single-time payments using `PaymentService.verifyRazorpaySignature()`
- Added logic to create one-time subscriptions using `SubscriptionService.createOneTimeSubscription()`
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive

### 3. `services/subscriptionService.js`
### 4. `payments-service/services/subscriptionService.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `payment.captured` event handling in `handleWebhook()` method
- Added new `handlePaymentCaptured()` method to process one-time payment webhooks
- Enhanced webhook handling to support both subscription and order-based payments

## How It Works Now

### Single-Time Payment Flow
1. **Order Creation**: `POST /api/subscriptions/create-order` with `recurring: false`
2. **Payment Processing**: User pays via Razorpay SDK
3. **Payment Verification**: `POST /api/subscriptions/verify-payment` with:
   - `razorpay_order_id`
   - `razorpay_payment_id`
   - `razorpay_signature`
   - `plan` (monthly/yearly)
4. **Subscription Creation**: Creates one-time subscription with `isRecurring: false`

### Recurring Subscription Flow
1. **Subscription Creation**: `POST /api/subscriptions/create-order` with `recurring: true`
2. **Payment Processing**: User pays via Razorpay SDK
3. **Payment Verification**: `POST /api/subscriptions/verify-payment` with:
   - `razorpay_subscription_id`
   - `razorpay_payment_id`
   - `razorpay_signature`
   - `plan` (monthly/yearly)
4. **Subscription Activation**: Activates recurring subscription with `isRecurring: true`

## Verification Logic

The updated `verifyPayment` function now:

1. **Checks for subscription payment** (`razorpay_subscription_id` present):
   - Uses `PaymentService.verifyRazorpaySubscriptionSignature()`
   - Calls `SubscriptionService.activateRecurringSubscription()`

2. **Checks for single-time payment** (`razorpay_order_id` present):
   - Uses `PaymentService.verifyRazorpaySignature()`
   - Calls `SubscriptionService.createOneTimeSubscription()`

3. **Returns error** if neither payment type is detected

## Webhook Support

Enhanced webhook handling to support:
- `subscription.charged` - For recurring subscription renewals
- `payment.captured` - For single-time payment confirmations
- `payment.failed` - For failed payments (both types)
- `subscription.cancelled` - For cancelled subscriptions
- `subscription.completed` - For completed subscriptions

## Testing

Created test files:
- `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive API documentation
- `test_payment_verification.js` - Test script with examples

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can choose between one-time and recurring payments
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing recurring subscription flow unchanged
3. **Better Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages
4. **Webhook Support**: Both payment types handled in webhooks
5. **Consistent API**: Same endpoint handles both payment types

## Usage Examples

### Single-Time Payment Request
```json
{
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "razorpay_signature": "signature_hash",
  "plan": "monthly"
}
```

### Recurring Payment Request
```json
{
  "razorpay_subscription_id": "sub_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "razorpay_signature": "signature_hash",
  "plan": "monthly"
}
```

Both requests return the same response format with subscription details.

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with actual Razorpay payments
2. Monitor webhook events for both payment types
3. Update mobile app to handle both payment flows
4. Consider adding payment type preference in user settings
